# Text-Based Emotion Classification

This project aims to detect the emotions behind text expressions. Similar to sentiment analysis, emotion analysis recognizes different types of feelings through the expression of texts. In this project, the author implemented 4 different text classification methods (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Fasttext and Long Short Term Memory models) and compared their performances in correctly recognizing 6 emotions (sadness, surprise, anger, fear, joy and love) from the text. All source code can be found in `src/`.
